# wiwik-insiders

wiwik-insiders is a private fork of wiwik, hosted as a private GitHub repository.
Almost1 all new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they
are immediately available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators
of this repository.

Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a funding
goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into wiwik and
released for general availability, making them available to all users.
Bugfixes are always released in tandem.

Sponsorships start as low as $15 a month.

## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of
new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general
support. The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.

## What's in it for me?

The moment you become a sponsor, you'll get immediate access to additional
features that you can start using right away, and which are currently
exclusively available to sponsors:

- [x] **helm-charts**: Enable easy deployment on kubernetes cluster.
- [x] **Post drafts**: Allow saving posts without publishing them, excellent for crawling existing knowledge
- [x] **Integration with slack**: Post from slack, search from slack, send notifications on slack.


## Terms

_Are we allowed to use wiwik-insiders under the same terms and conditions as regular wiwik?_

Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use wiwik-insiders precisely under the same terms as wiwik, which are given by the MIT license. However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy:

- Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy.

- If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like. Just remember that [GitHub deletes private forks](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).
