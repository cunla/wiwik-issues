# wiwik-insiders

wiwik-insiders is a private fork of wiwik, hosted as a private GitHub repository.
Almost all new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they
are immediately available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators
of this repository.

Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a funding
goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into wiwik and
released for general availability, making them available to all users.
Bugfixes are always released in tandem.

Sponsorships start as low as $15 a month.

## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of
new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general
support. The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.

## What's in it for me?

The moment you become a sponsor, you'll get immediate access to additional
features that you can start using right away, and which are currently
exclusively available to sponsors (such as integration with Slack).
Additionally, any issues you experience will be prioritized.

## How to become a sponsor

Thanks for your interest in sponsoring! In order to become an eligible sponsor
with your GitHub account, visit [cunla's sponsor profile](https://github.com/sponsors/cunla), and complete
a sponsorship of __$15 a month or more__. You can use your individual or
organization GitHub account for sponsoring.

__Important__: If you're sponsoring @cunla through a GitHub organization,
please send a short email to daniel@moransoftware.com with the name of your
organization and the GitHub account of the individual that should be added as a
collaborator.[^4]

You can cancel your sponsorship anytime.[^5]

[^4]:
It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an
organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after
sponsoring, please email daniel@moransoftware.ca, stating which
account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're
working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler.
To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account,
create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific
individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to
the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the
private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the
organizations.

[^5]:
If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request
which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means
that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to
Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are
processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information
regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are
non-refundable.

## Terms

_Are we allowed to use wiwik-insiders under the same terms and conditions as regular wiwik?_

Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use wiwik-insiders precisely under the same terms as wiwik,
which are given by the MIT license. However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy:

- Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects,
  privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware
  strategy.

- If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future
  updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like. Just
  remember
  that [GitHub deletes private forks](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).
